## 🔥 Overview

Flex-&pi; is a 6B-parameter world-action model for robot manipulation. It jointly
predicts **future RGB**, **3D pointmaps**, **DINOv3 semantics**, and **actions** in
training, then deploys as a VLA, as a full world-action model, or as anything in
between — all from **a single checkpoint**. Most world-action models predict one thing,
future RGB latents: a strong prior, but one trained to reconstruct pixels, carrying no
explicit signal for the 3D geometry or object semantics that manipulation actually needs.

Geometry and semantics arrive through frozen, off-the-shelf encoders — and the Wan-2.2
video VAE, trained only on RGB pixels, turns out to encode 3D pointmaps
**almost losslessly**. All three become token streams in one shared latent space,
co-denoised with actions inside a **Mixture-of-Transformers**. Training then drops visual
streams at random and makes the model generate the ones it never saw as input —
***cross-modality forcing*** — so the backbone has to internalize each modality from the
others. What comes out is one checkpoint that runs **any subset of streams**, in and
out — action-only at 60 ms, full joint generation at 193 ms, anywhere in between, all
selected by a runtime flag.

### Key Features

- **One checkpoint, any regime.** 56 deployable combinations of observed and generated
  streams from one set of weights, from VLA latency to full joint generation. Any input,
  any output, no retraining — depth sensor optional.
- **VLA latency, WAM performance.** Action-only runs at ~60 ms/call on an RTX 5090 —
  faster than every baseline we compare against, and still ahead of all of them on every
  real-world task. Generating the visual futures too costs latency and wins more.
- **Real-world precision and dexterity.** Ahead of &pi;<sub>0.5</sub>, ManiFlow and Fast-WAM
  on all five bimanual YAM tasks — 2.3&times; the success rate of the strongest — including
  an eight-stage gripper self-repair whose tightest insertion leaves &plusmn;0.25 mm of
  clearance, and the most robust to unseen objects and clutter.
- **Learns from fewer demonstrations.** The world-action objective stands in for data:
  1.9&ndash;4.5&times; the success of the baselines at 50&ndash;100 RoboTwin demos per
  task, and on the real robot half the demonstrations still beat every baseline trained on
  all of them. At full data: 94.6% on RoboTwin's 50 tasks, up to 99.2% on LIBERO.

## 📦 Model Download

| Benchmark | Checkpoint | Trained on |
|---|---|---|
| RoboTwin 2.0 | [`flexpi-robotwin`](https://huggingface.co/flex-pi/flexpi-robotwin) | 50 tasks, 2,500 clean + 25,000 domain-randomized demos |
| LIBERO | [`flexpi-libero`](https://huggingface.co/flex-pi/flexpi-libero) | all four suites, stream dropout at every `p` |
| LIBERO | [`flexpi-libero-fulljoint-star`](https://huggingface.co/flex-pi/flexpi-libero-fulljoint-star) | all four suites, no dropout — always jointly denoised |

We plan to release large-scale checkpoints pre-trained on YAM, AgiBot World, and
DROID. Stay tuned!

## 💻 Requirements

Linux x86_64, CUDA 12.8, Python 3.10.

| Mode | Memory | GPUs |
|---|---:|---|
| Inference, deployment | 16&ndash;26 GB | 1 &times; RTX 4090 / 5090 |
| Training | 80 GB each | 4&ndash;8 &times; A100 80GB / H100 / H200 |

Inference peaks are measured on an RTX 5090; the top of the range is the TensorRT
stack. The launchers assume 8 GPUs; 4 is the floor, and proportionally slower. LoRA
fine-tuning, which would lower that floor, is planned.

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/geyan21/flex-pi.git
cd flex-pi
```

Then follow **[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)** — conda, uv and Docker recipes for
the one environment that covers training, evaluation and deployment, plus the weights
and the simulators. Everything after this point runs from the repository root.

## 🧩 Model Preparation

Run once, before the first training run.

```bash
cd flex-pi                      # the project directory
mkdir -p checkpoints
export DIFFSYNTH_MODEL_BASE_PATH="$(pwd)/checkpoints"
```

Then fetch the weights — Wan2.2-TI2V-5B plus the resampled ActionDiT backbone, the
T5 text-embedding cache, and DINOv3. Refer to
**[docs/INSTALL.md §2](docs/INSTALL.md#2-weights)**.

## 📊 Data Preparation

Every dataset is published at [huggingface.co/flex-pi](https://huggingface.co/flex-pi),
ready to train on as downloaded. To build your own instead, the layout to match is a
LeRobot v2.1 dataset with canonical camera keys — [docs/TRAINING.md §1.2](docs/TRAINING.md).

| Benchmark | Repository |
|---|---|
| LIBERO | `libero_mujoco3.3.2_depth` — all four suites |
| RoboTwin 2.0 | `robotwin_3d`, plus `robotwin_3d_text_embeds_cache` to skip the T5 precompute |
| Real-world YAM | one per task — `put_plate_on_the_rack`, `sort_utensils`, `kitchen_organization`, `soft_bag_zipping`, `self_repair_gripper_bc`, `self_repair_gripper_dagger` |

```bash
huggingface-cli download flex-pi/libero_mujoco3.3.2_depth \
  --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./data/libero_mujoco3.3.2_depth
```

## 🚀 Training

Each benchmark has a launcher that wraps `accelerate launch scripts/train.py` with
DeepSpeed ZeRO-1. Edit the config block at the top of one — GPUs, batch size, epochs,
dataset paths — and run it.

```bash
# RoboTwin
bash scripts/train_flexpi_robotwin.sh

# LIBERO 4-suite
bash scripts/train_flexpi_libero.sh

# Real-world YAM bimanual
DATASET_DIRS="[./data/<your_yam_set>]" bash scripts/train_flexpi_yam.sh
```

They default to 8 GPUs and write to
`runs/<task_config>/<run_id>_<regime_tag>/` — the `config.yaml` and
`dataset_stats.json` that evaluation reads back land there beside the checkpoints.

Every knob and recipe is in **[docs/TRAINING.md](docs/TRAINING.md)**, and each
benchmark has an end-to-end guide: **[RoboTwin](docs/ROBOTWIN.md)** &middot;
**[LIBERO](docs/LIBERO.md)** &middot; **[YAM](docs/YAM.md)**.

## 🎯 Evaluation

Both need their simulator installed
([docs/INSTALL.md §4](docs/INSTALL.md#4-simulators-evaluation-only)). Match the GPU
count to your machine.

### RoboTwin 2.0

```bash
huggingface-cli download flex-pi/flexpi-robotwin --local-dir runs/flexpi-robotwin

# then set these two lines at the top of scripts/eval_flexpi_robotwin.sh:
#   CKPT="./runs/flexpi-robotwin/checkpoints/weights/step_048060.pt"
#   DATASET_STATS="./runs/flexpi-robotwin/dataset_stats.json"

bash scripts/eval_flexpi_robotwin.sh
```

The defaults are the full-joint regime; setting the three `INFER_JOINT_*` flags to
`false` gives action-only. A full sweep is 50 tasks &times; 2 phases &times; 100
episodes.

### LIBERO

```bash
huggingface-cli download flex-pi/flexpi-libero-fulljoint-star \
  --local-dir runs/flexpi-libero-fulljoint-star

CKPT=$(ls runs/flexpi-libero-fulljoint-star/checkpoints/weights/*.pt) \
DATASET_STATS=runs/flexpi-libero-fulljoint-star/dataset_stats.json \
GPUS=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 \
  bash scripts/eval_flexpi_libero_4suite.sh
```

It shards the 40 tasks across the GPUs and writes `summary_4suite.{csv,json}`. A
partial sweep is reported as `INCOMPLETE` rather than averaged silently.

Protocol, knobs and troubleshooting: [RoboTwin](docs/ROBOTWIN.md#3-evaluate)
&middot; [LIBERO](docs/LIBERO.md#3-evaluate) &middot;
[YAM](docs/YAM.md#3-deploy-server).

## 🔀 Inference Regimes

`infer_joint_*` picks what gets **generated**, `infer_present_*` what gets **encoded
as input** — 56 combinations from one checkpoint. An unset flag takes the trained
default.

```bash
# action only — the fast path
python experiments/robotwin/run_robotwin_manager.py task=... ckpt=... \
  +EVALUATION.infer_joint_video=false \
  +EVALUATION.infer_joint_dino=false \
  +EVALUATION.infer_joint_pointmap=false

# full joint generation — the accurate path
python experiments/robotwin/run_robotwin_manager.py task=... ckpt=... \
  +EVALUATION.infer_joint_video=true \
  +EVALUATION.infer_joint_dino=true \
  +EVALUATION.infer_joint_pointmap=true
```

The eval launchers wrap these as `INFER_JOINT_*` / `INFER_PRESENT_*`, with the full
regime table in their headers.

## 🦾 Real-World Deployment

The policy runs as a WebSocket server; the robot client sends observations and
receives action chunks.

```bash
conda activate flexpi
export DIFFSYNTH_MODEL_BASE_PATH=/path/to/wan22_weights
python scripts/serve_yam_flexpi.py \
    --ckpt-path <run>/checkpoints/weights/step_NNNNNN.pt \
    --default-prompt "<language instruction>"
```

`dataset_stats.json` and `config.yaml` are picked up next to the checkpoint.
`scripts/serve_flexpi_yam.sh` wraps this with the regime
(`--infer-joint-*` / `--infer-present-*`) and TensorRT knobs already wired up.

The msgpack wire contract a client must speak, and the reference bridge, live in
[`experiments/yam/flexpi_policy/`](experiments/yam/flexpi_policy/).
[docs/YAM.md](docs/YAM.md) covers the three serving configurations, that wire
contract, and the rules that have caused emergency stops on real hardware.

## ⚡ Inference Optimization

Training-free — the same checkpoint, made faster. ms/call on an RTX 5090 at four
denoise steps:

| Stack | full joint | action only |
|---|---:|---:|
| eager PyTorch | 447 | 132 |
| **torch.compile** — the default | 360 | **60** |
| + TensorRT joint engine | 230 | — |
| **+ TensorRT KV-split engines** | **193** | — |

TensorRT is optional and applies to the joint path only; everything runs without it.
[`scripts/inference_opt/benchmark_flex_latency.py`](scripts/inference_opt/) reproduces
the table, and [docs/INFERENCE_OPTIMIZATION.md](docs/INFERENCE_OPTIMIZATION.md) has the
engine builds and the server knobs.
