"""Wan2.2 MoT backbone for FlexPi.

Owned by this package, so ``FlexPiBackbone`` has no import dependency on
the ``FlexPi`` model that extends it. The 7 methods that
FlexPi fully overrides without ever calling back into
(``forward``, ``from_wan22_pretrained``, ``infer``, ``infer_action``,
``infer_joint``, ``save_checkpoint``, ``training_loss``) are omitted.

Everything here — the VAE encode/decode path, the MoT attention-mask builders,
the flow-matching denoise loop, ``prepare_for_inference`` and its
torch.compile / quantization / TensorRT / CUDA-graph wiring — is shared
machinery that FlexPi uses unchanged.

        Call after ``load_checkpoint()`` and ``eval()``. Quantization is applied
        first, then torch.compile wraps the (possibly quantized) methods.

        Args:
            torch_compile: Compile MoT inference methods with ``torch.compile``.
            torch_compile_mode: Compilation mode — ``"default"``,
                ``"reduce-overhead"`` (CUDA graphs, best for fixed-shape loops),
                or ``"max-autotune"``.
            quantization: Weight quantization method. Supports ``"int8"``
                (INT8 weight-only), ``"fp8"`` (FP8 dynamic activation + FP8
                weight, per-tensor scaling — needs SM89+ hardware, e.g.
                Ada/Hopper/Blackwell), and ``"fp8_video"`` (fp8 on the video
                expert only — speeds up the M>=534 prefill/joint GEMMs while
                keeping the M=32 action expert bf16, where fp8 is a net
                loss), all via torchao. Requires ``pip install torchao``.
            torch_compile_scope: ``"step"`` (default) compiles one denoise step
                and re-enters Python between steps. ``"loop"`` compiles the
                entire denoise loop (all steps + scheduler updates unrolled)
                into a single graph — zero host round-trips per step, at the
                cost of a longer first-call compile. Ignored when
                ``torch_compile=False``; falls back to per-step dispatch when a
                path has no loop-scope variant (e.g. dynamic step-skip).
            attn_backend: ``"sdpa"`` (default) runs joint attention as SDPA
                with a dense bool mask (memory-efficient backend).
                ``"flex"`` serves the static per-regime joint mask as a
                FlexAttention BlockMask (~2x faster masked attention; joint
                denoise paths only — the action-only KV-cache path and HBridge
                outer layers stay on SDPA).
                ``"auto"`` picks the fastest SDPA kernel per site: the
                action-fast-path masks are all-True by construction, so they
                are dropped and SDPA dispatches flash (~4x over the masked
                memory-efficient kernel at deploy shapes); joint denoise
                paths keep their non-trivial dense mask but run with
                cuDNN-first backend priority (~2.6x at joint shapes on
                Blackwell). Same math as "sdpa" — only the kernel changes.
                Mask drops apply on the compiled fast paths
                (``torch_compile=True``).
            compile_encoders: Also compile the observation encoders (VAE
                first-frame encode, DINO encode, pointmap encode) — outside
                the MoT compile targets but ~20 ms/call at deploy shapes.
                Off by default; requires ``torch_compile=True``.
            trt_joint_engine_path: Serialized TensorRT engine for the flex
                JOINT denoise core (built offline by
                ``scripts/inference_opt/trt_onnx_joint_engine.py``). When set, the joint
                core routes through the engine while encoders, pre/post_dit
                and schedulers stay in torch; the joint step itself runs
                uncompiled (the engine call cannot live inside an inductor
                CUDA graph) and off-shape calls fall back to the torch path.
                Incompatible with ``attn_backend="flex"`` (the engine
                consumes the dense joint mask). The engine carries its own
                fp16 weights, so pair with ``quantization=null``.
            trt_joint_free_video_blocks: With the engine active, release the
                torch-side video-expert block weights (~8.5 GB — the engine
                duplicates them in fp16). Frees VRAM for co-resident
                consumers (SAPIEN/Vulkan sim rendering); the torch fallback
                for the joint core then RAISES instead of falling back, and
                action-regime prefill / checkpointing become unavailable.
            trt_prefill_engine_path: Serialized TensorRT engine for the
                action-only KV-cache prefill (the 30-layer video-expert pass
                over the anchor tokens — the biggest action-path phase after
                denoise). Built offline by
                ``scripts/inference_opt/trt_onnx_prefill_engine.py``; shadows
                ``mot.prefill_video_cache``, off-shape calls fall back to
                torch. Independent of ``trt_joint_engine_path`` (different
                regime).
            solver: Inference ODE solver — ``"euler"`` (default, unchanged) or
                ``"dpmpp_2m"`` (DPM-Solver++(2M), a 2nd-order multistep that
                holds quality at fewer denoise steps). Engages on the eager /
                per-step joint denoise loop (including the TRT-engine path);
                the loop-scope-compiled joint/action paths stay Euler (a
                per-step host sync would break their CUDA-graph capture). Off =
                byte-identical.
            glue_cache: Memoize per-call/per-step CONSTANT inference glue —
                DINO/pointmap RoPE freqs, the joint attention mask, and the
                HBridge self-masks — keyed on shapes + device + regime bits.
                All are pure functions of those keys, so hits are bit-identical
                to a rebuild; kills ~25 ms of host-side CPU (and the GPU idle
                it causes) per joint TRT-engine call. Inference-only (memos are
                bypassed under ``self.training``). Off (default) = rebuild
                every time, exactly the prior behavior.
            encoder_cuda_graph: Capture each of the three first-frame anchor
                encoders (VAE / DINO / pointmap) as a CUDA graph on its first
                deploy-signature call and replay it as a single launch — the
                encoders are host-LAUNCH-rate-limited (§9.6), so this removes
                their ~7-12 ms of per-call launch cost each. Bitwise replay
                self-check at capture; any capture failure or off-signature
                call (val full-video encodes, tiled) falls back to eager.
                Mutually exclusive with ``compile_encoders``. Off (default) =
                eager encoders, exactly the prior behavior.
            joint_loop_cuda_graph: Capture the entire 10-step joint denoise
                loop (``_joint_denoise_loop_body``: per-step pre_dit → joint
                core → post_dit → x0→v → Euler updates → frame-0 reclamps) as
                ONE CUDA graph and replay it per infer call — removing the
                per-step eager host-launch cost that the TRT-engine path pays
                because inductor cannot trace the opaque engine call (manual
                capture can). Bit-identical to the eager loop under Euler +
                step-skip-off (verified by a warmup-vs-replay self-check);
                engages only in that regime and falls back to eager otherwise.
                Off (default) = the per-step eager loop, exactly the prior
                behavior. MEASURED CAVEAT: with ``trt_joint_engine_path``
                active the capture fails — the TRT engine's ``execute_async_v3``
                enqueue is not CUDA-graph-capturable (bare capture error, not a
                hoistable op) — and silently falls back to eager, so it is a
                no-op on the deploy engine path (the host-overhead ceiling it
                targets is only ~3%). Retained for the non-engine compiled path
                / a future capturable engine.
